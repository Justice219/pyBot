# pyTicketsBot

A simple, yet powerful discord tickets bot created with [Pycord](https://pycord.dev")  
This is a heavy work in progress.


## Deployment

Python 3.10 or 3.11 required.

Install the needed requirements using the txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a file titled ``.env`` in the project directory.  
Inside the ``.env`` file, add a token line, and fill in your [bots token](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/).
```
TOKEN = YOUR_TOKEN
```
Now, head under ``settings.json`` and configure ``guild_id``, ``category_id``, and anything else you'd like to make changes to.

Once the bot has been pre-configured to your preferences, run the ``bot.py`` file, and watch the ticket system come to life!
